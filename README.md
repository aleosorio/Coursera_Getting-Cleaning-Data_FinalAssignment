This peer graded assignment is based on the following 2 files:

1) "run_analysis.R": code that, when executed, delivers the "tidydataset.txt" file which contains the required tidy dataset.
  1.a) Every step of the code is explained in detail, using ## marks within the code.
  1.b) The only lines that require attention if willing to run this code in other pc, are those that set the working directory, import files and finally deliver the final tidy dataset (should be configured to your personal PC settings).

2) "CodeBook.md": file that, using the same structure of "run_analysis.R", explains in detail each one of its steps.  It consists basically on a summary of the comments included in the code, as stated in 1.a).  It includes the functions used.

Any further doubts, you can contact the author through his "aleosorio/Coursera_Getting-Cleaning-Data_FinalAssignment" repository in Github.
